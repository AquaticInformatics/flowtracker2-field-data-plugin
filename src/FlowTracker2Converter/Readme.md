# FlowTracker2Converter

This standalone utility will allow AQUARIUS 3.X customers to read FlowTracker2 device measurements.

It converts `*.ft` measurement files into FlowTracker1 `*.dis` discharge summary files which can then be imported into AQTS 3.X.

Simply drag and drop your files onto the GUI app, and your file will be converted.
